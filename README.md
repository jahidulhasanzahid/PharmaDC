This is my pet project. I started this from December 2025. I took this idea about 4 months ago and i did paper work and planning how and what will the requirement for this project. I talked with different Pharma QA people and find the actual problem. Now i decide to work on it. Global market have solution for this problem already. But i want to build more user friendly and more indibidual individual project. Also it can be configurable based on company to companby SOP.

Main goal of PharmaDC is to maintain and keep all kind of job batch record history documented by online. Reduce paper work, Keep less mistake and make online for more easy, less mistake, share with client and easy to access from any where in the world.
